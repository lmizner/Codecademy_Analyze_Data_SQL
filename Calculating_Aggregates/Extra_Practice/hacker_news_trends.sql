-- Start by getting a feel for the hacker_news table!
-- Let’s find the most popular Hacker News stories.
-- What are the top five stories with the highest scores?
SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;


-- Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users (1-9-90 Rule).
-- Is this true of Hacker News?
-- Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points?
-- First, find the total score of all the stories.
SELECT SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news;


-- Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories.
-- Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores.
-- GROUP BY and HAVING are needed!
SELECT user, SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY SUM(score) DESC;


-- Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage.
-- Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum.
-- So, is Hacker News dominated by these users?
SELECT (100*(517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0);


-- Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are rickrolling — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video and claiming that it links to information about coding.
-- The url of the video is:
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
-- How many times has each offending user posted this link?
SELECT user, COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;


-- Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites.
-- Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most:
-- GitHub, Medium, or New York Times?
-- First, we want to categorize each story based on their source.
SELECT CASE
    WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
    WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
    WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source'
FROM hacker_news;


-- Next, build on the previous query:
-- Add a column for the number of stories from each URL using COUNT().
-- Also, GROUP BY the CASE statement.
-- Remember that you can refer to a column in GROUP BY using a number.
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
    WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
    WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;


-- Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but…
-- What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?
-- Before we get started, let’s run this query and take a look at the timestamp column.
SELECT timestamp
FROM hacker_news
LIMIT 10;


-- SQLite comes with a strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.
-- It takes two arguments: strftime(format, column)
-- Let’s test this function out
SELECT timestamp,
  strftime('%H', timestamp)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;


-- Okay, now we understand how strftime() works. Let’s write a query that returns three columns:
-- The hours of the timestamp
-- The average score for each hour
-- The count of stories for each hour
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp), AVG(score), COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


-- Let’s edit a few things in the previous query:
-- Round the average scores (ROUND()).
-- Rename the columns to make it more readable (AS).
-- Add a WHERE clause to filter out the NULL values in timestamp.
-- Take a look at the result again:
-- What are the best hours to post a story on Hacker News?
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'Hour', ROUND(AVG(score), 1) AS 'Average Score', 
   COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Stories'
FROM hacker_news
WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
